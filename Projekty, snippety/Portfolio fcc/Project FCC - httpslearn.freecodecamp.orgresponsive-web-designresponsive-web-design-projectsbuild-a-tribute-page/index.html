                <h2>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h2>
                <li><span> 1923 </span>Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
                <li><span>1933</span> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks to a
                    Depression era
                    program known as the "National Youth Administration"</li>
                <li><span>1935</span> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian Conservation
                    Corps, helping
                    starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."</li>


                <li><span>1941</span> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is
                    rejected. Instead, the
                    military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disenfectants, and
                    other
                    applied science.</li>
                <li><span>1942</span> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
                <li><span>1944</span> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant
                    wife, and flies to
                    Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000
                    different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major
                    climate
                    on Earth.</li>
                <li><span>1945</span> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields</li>
                <li><span>1953</span> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling American
                    breed, creating a
                    strain that responds well to fertalizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li>
                <li><span>1962</span> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian
                    subcontinent in
                    time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population</li>
                <li><span>1970</span> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
                <li><span>1983</span> - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and sorghum
                    yields</li>
                <li><span>1984</span> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li>
                <li><span>2005</span> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues that
                    genetically
                    modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that
                    GM
                    crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals
                    for
                    a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li>
                <li><span>2009</span> - dies at the age of 95.</li>
